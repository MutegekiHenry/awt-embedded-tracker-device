#### What is the AWT?

######The Anti-wandering Tracker Device


Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent
deficits in social communication and social interaction and restricted and repetitive behaviors,
interests, and activities1. According to Uganda’s 2014 census, the national autism spectrum
disorder prevalence was 70/10,000 persons at a population of 34,900,000. The current prevalence
of ASD in Uganda is 88/10,000 persons. Autistic children normally suffer from wandering/getting
lost which may result in injuries or fatalities.


A research study was carried out to understand the entire autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
challenges faced by Autistic children, how the challenges are currently being solved, and how we
can use technology to improve the living conditions of autistic children. The team designed an
Anti-Wandering Tracker (AWT) to improve the monitoring and tracking of autistic children during
wandering episodes thus reducing the chances of injury or deaths that occur during wandering.
The AWT system comprises two subsystems, the embedded system (The AWT device) and the
mobile application. The embedded system (AWT device) is a wearable waist belt that takes in
perimeter such as the live location of the child and sends them to the database. The mobile
application retrieves and displays the location details, alerts the caretaker when the child
approaches or exceeds the defined safe perimeter. The caretaker then goes ahead to track the child
thus reducing the child’s exposure to danger.
